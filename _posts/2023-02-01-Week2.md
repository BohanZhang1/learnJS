# JavaScript Fetch API and Event Listeners

The following code is taken from a reserch project I have been working on, which is a get request sent by java scrip method fetch, and a button listender for sending the mission to the backend of my project.

```javascript
fetch("/mission",{
    method: 'GET',
})
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        let files = data;
        for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {
            let file = files[i];
            let option = document.createElement("option");
            option.textContent = file;
            fileList.appendChild(option);
        }
    });

runButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
    let fileName = fileList.value;
    let data = {file: fileName};
    fetch("mission", {
        method: "POST",
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    })
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(result => {
            output.textContent = result
            console.log(result);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
        });
});
```
I will be explaining how the Fetch API and Event Listeners work in JavaScript.

## Fetch API
The Fetch API is an interface for fetching resources. It allows us to make HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses from a server. In the code snippet, we use the fetch function to send two GET and POST requests.

### GET Request
The first fetch request is a GET request to "/mission". The fetch method is used to send a GET request, with an options object passed as its second parameter. The options object contains the method property with the value 'GET', which specifies the type of request we want to make.

`.then(response => response.json())`
The response from the GET request is returned as a Promise. We use the then method to chain another Promise that converts the response from the server into a JSON object using the response.json() method.

`.then(data => {...})`
The next then method receives the JSON object as an argument. We then loop through the data, which is an array of file names, and create an HTML option element for each file. The option elements are then added to the fileList element, which is a select element.

### POST Request
The second fetch request is a POST request to "/mission". This request is triggered by a click event on the runButton element.

## Event Listener

`runButton.addEventListener("click", function() {...});`
The addEventListener method is used to add an event listener to the runButton element. When the button is clicked, the anonymous function inside the addEventListener method is executed.

In the function, we first get the selected file name from the fileList element. We then create a data object with a single property, "file", and set its value to the selected file name.

`fetch("mission", {...});`
We then use the fetch method to send a POST request to "/mission". The fetch method takes two arguments, the URL and an options object. The options object contains the method property with the value "POST", which specifies the type of request we want to make, the body property with the value of the data object stringified using the JSON.stringify method, and a headers property with the content-type set to "application/json".

`.then(response => response.text())`
The response from the server is returned as a Promise. We use the then method to chain another Promise that extracts the text content of the response using the response.text() method.

`.then(result => {...})`
The next then method receives the text content as an argument. We then set the text content of the output element to the result and log the result to the console.

`.catch(error => {...});`
Finally, we use the catch method to log any errors that occur during the fetch request to the console.

In conclusion, the code snippet demonstrates how to use the Fetch API and Event Listeners in JavaScript to send GET and POST requests and handle their responses.
