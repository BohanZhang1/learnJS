# Node.js 
After learning about Node.js, I was able to create a simple web server using Node.js. 

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
It is used to create web servers, command line tools, and desktop applications.
Some of the advantages of using Node.js are:
- It is fast
- easy to learn
- open source
- cross-platform

## Installing Node.js
To install Node.js, you can download it from the Node.js website.
https://nodejs.org/en/

after installing Node.js, you can check the version of Node.js by running the following command in the terminal.
```bash
node -v
```
if it is installed correctly, it should print the version of Node.js.

## Creating a web server using Node.js
```javascript
const http = require('http');

const hostname = 'localhost';  // IP address of the server
const port = 3000;  // Port number of the server

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');

});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
In the above code, we are creating a web server that listens on port 3000. 
When a request is made to the server, it will respond with the text "Hello World".

## Debugging Node.js
To debug Node.js, you can use the built-in debugger. 
```bash
node --inspect-brk index.js
```
This will start the debugger and pause the execution of the code.

## Node.js modules
Node.js has a built-in module system.
```javascript
const http = require('http');
```
This is how you import a module. 
```javascript
module.exports = {
  add: add,
  subtract: subtract
};
```
This is how you export a module.

## Node.js file system
Node.js has a built-in file system module.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('input.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log(data.toString());
});
```
This is how you read a file.

## Node.js events
Node.js has a built-in events module.
```javascript
const events = require('events');

const eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

const connectHandler = () => {
  console.log('connection successful.');

  eventEmitter.emit('data_received');
}

eventEmitter.on('connection', connectHandler);

eventEmitter.on('data_received', () => {
  console.log('data received successfully.');
});

eventEmitter.emit('connection');

console.log("Program Ended.");
```

## Node.js streams
Node.js has a built-in streams module.
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const data = '';

const readerStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');

readerStream.setEncoding('UTF8');

readerStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  data += chunk;
});

readerStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log(data);
});

readerStream.on('error', (err) => {
  console.log(err.stack);
});

console.log("Program Ended");
```
in the above code, we are reading data from the input.txt file and printing it to the console.

## Node.js buffer
Node.js has a built-in buffer module.
```javascript
const buf = Buffer.alloc(256);

len = buf.write("Simply Easy Learning");

console.log("Octets written : "+  len);
```
in the above code, we are creating a buffer of size 256 and writing the string "Simply Easy Learning" to the buffer.

## Node.js global objects
Node.js has a built-in global objects module.
```javascript
__filename = "index.js"
__dirname = "some_directory/some_sub"
```
we use the '__' prefix to indicate that these are global objects.

These are global objects that are available in all modules.

to get the current directory name, you can use the following code.
```javascript
console.log(__dirname);
```
the way to define a global function is as follows.
```javascript
global.console.log("Hello World");
```

## Node.js process
Node.js has a built-in process module.
```javascript
process.argv.forEach((val, index) => {
  console.log(`${index}: ${val}`);
});
```
in the above code, we are printing the command line arguments.

`forEach` method is used to iterate over the array.

`(val, index)` is the callback function that is called for each element in the array.

`$` is used to embed the variable in the string.


## Node.js child process
Node.js has a built-in child process module.
```javascript
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);

ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
});

ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`stderr: ${data}`);
});

ls.on('close', (code) => {
  console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
});
```
in the above code, we are spawning a child process using the `spawn` method.

`ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {})` is used to read the data from the child process.

`ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {})` is used to read the error from the child process.

`ls.on('close', (code) => {})` is used to read the exit code from the child process.

## Node.js URL
Node.js has a built-in URL module.
```javascript
const url = require('url');

const myURL = new URL('https://example.org/foo');

myURL.searchParams.append('abc', '123');
console.log(myURL.href);
```
in the above code, we are creating a new URL object and appending a query parameter to it.
A url object is used to parse the url, get the query parameters, and get the path.


## Challenges
The challenges I faced while learning Node.js are:
- I had to learn how to use the terminal.
- learn how to use the debugger.
- learn how to use the built-in modules.
- understand the concepts of streams, buffers, and events.
- Understand what each module does.

## Conclusion
Node.js is a powerful tool that can be used to create web servers, web applications, and command line tools.

It is a great tool to learn if you want to become a full stack developer.
