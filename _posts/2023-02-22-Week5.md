# Arrays, loops, and conditional statements in JS
After a reevaluation of my current learning state, I think I should revisit some of the fundamentals of JS. 

I have been working on a project that requires me to use arrays, loops, and conditional statements. 

I was able to get the project to work, but I feel like I am not using the best practices. 
So I am going to go back and redo the project using the best practices and summarize what I learned.

### Arrays
Constructing an array is simple. 
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
You can also create an empty array and add elements to it later. 
```javascript
let arr = [];
arr.push(1);
arr.push(2);
arr.push(3);
arr.push(4);
arr.push(5);
```
You can also create an array with a specific length and fill it with a default value. 
```javascript
let arr = new Array(5).fill(0);
```
Deleting an element from an array is also simple. 
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.splice(2, 1);
```
This will delete the element at index 2. 

where the first argument is the index and the second argument is the number of elements to delete.

### Loops
There are two types of loops in JS.
1. for loop
2. while loop

#### for loop
The for loop is used to iterate over an array. 
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```
The for loop is also used to iterate over a string. 
```javascript
let str = "Hello World";
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    console.log(str[i]);
}
```
#### while loop
The while loop is used to iterate over an array. 
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
    i++;
}
```
The while loop is also used to iterate over a string. 
```javascript
let str = "Hello World";
let i = 0;
while (i < str.length) {
    console.log(str[i]);
    i++;
}
```
### Conditional statements
Conditional statements are used to check if a condition is true or false. 
```javascript   
let num = 5;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("num is positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("num is negative");
} else {
    console.log("num is zero");
}
```
### Summary
The syntax of JS is very similar to C++.

The only difference is that JS uses semicolons at the end of each statement.

I think I will be able to use the knowledge I gained from this project to help me with my future projects.

I will also be able to use this knowledge to help me with my future interviews.

#### Challenge
After condensing what I have learned, I tried solving some leetcode problems.

I was able to solve 2 problems.

1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
```javascript
  var twoSum = function(nums, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) {
                return [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
};
```

2. [Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
```javascript
var reverse = function(x) {
    let str = x.toString();
    let arr = [];
    let result = 0;
    let sign = 1;
    if (str[0] === "-") {
        sign = -1;
        str = str.substring(1);
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        arr.push(str[i]);
    }
    arr.reverse();
    result = parseInt(arr.join(""));
    if (result > Math.pow(2, 31) - 1 || result < Math.pow(-2, 31)) {
        return 0;
    }
    return result * sign;
}
```
I was able to solve these problems using the knowledge I gained from this project.
These are easy problems, but I think I will be able to solve more difficult problems in the future.
For now I think the difficulty of the problems I am solving is good for me.
